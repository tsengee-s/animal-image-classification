A deep-learning model for animal detection can serve as a useful tool 
for nature reserves and national parks in Africa, to aid with continuous 
surveillance and the protection of wildlife.
The objective of this project is to develop an image classification model 
based on the following categories present in the training dataset: 
buffalo, cheetah, elephant, hyena, rhino, and zebra.
It is especially significant to able to correctly identify endangered 
animals, such as rhinos, as they are frequently targeted by poachers.
